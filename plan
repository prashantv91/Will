Will (working title)
A simulation.

Frontend and backend to be separate and communicate using sockets.

Frontend
    UI and other meta-things that are not really part of the game.
    In Python (curses not straightforward in Lisp).
    Drawing to screen and input.
        Screen resizing.
    Communicate with backend by TCP.
    
    Does not know anything that the player(character) does not - this is ensured by the info it receives.

Backend
    The game itself.
    In Lisp (experimenting).
